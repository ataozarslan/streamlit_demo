st.markdown("- According to [Procuswire](https://www.phocuswire.com/One-in-five-hotel-bookings-on-the-web-are-cancelled), did you know that **almost 20% of hotels rooms booked online are cancelled** before the guest arrives?")
st.markdown("- That’s **1 of every 5 bookings** you get!")
st.markdown("- It not only directly impacts the revenue, but also leads to poor marketing, since Online Travel Agencies keep track of cancellations drawn by a hotel.")
st.markdown("- Specifically, **cancellations made close to the time of service are the most damaging** for hotels because they leave management with no time to react!")
